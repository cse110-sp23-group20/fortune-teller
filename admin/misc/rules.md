# Team Working Agreement

## Purpose

This Team Working Agreement serves two primary purposes:

1. To help us develop and maintain a clear understanding of our team's collective standards, expectations, and commitment to one another.
2. To provide a framework for resolving any differences of opinion or disputes that may arise.

## Expectations

We expect all team members to:

- Respect each other's opinions and contributions.
- Work collaboratively to achieve our goals.
- Respect deadlines and deliver quality work.
- Communicate openly and honestly.
- Document all decisions and discuss issues proactively.
- Test code locally/thoroughly before committing/PR to the main branch

## Meetings
- Meetings will be scheduled using when2meet. If all 10 people can't make 1 meeting time(which will likely be common), meeting times will be adjusted to make sure no one is left out of a meeting 2 times in a row.

## Responsibilities

Each team member is responsible for:

- Staying up to date on the project’s progress and keep up with checking Slack.
- Participating in team meetings and discussions.
- Contributing ideas and feedback.
- Completing assigned tasks on time and to the best of your ability.

- Noting when one isn't available and being proactive with communication.

## Conflict Resolution

In the event of a disagreement or conflict, we agree to:

- Remain respectful of one another.
- Listen to each other's perspective.
- Work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.
- Find ways that all group members can continue to actively contribute by working through issues.
- Group leaders and everyone else will do their best to being open and honest about disagreements/conflicts and discussing them with others.

## Accountability

We understand that our team is ultimately responsible for the success of the project. Therefore, we will:

- Hold each other accountable for meeting deadlines and fulfilling our responsibilities.
- Establish metrics to measure our progress and success.
- Monitor our goals and adjust our approaches as needed.
